## **Overview**
This Circuit Simulator is a graphical application built using Python's `tkinter` library. It provides a user-friendly interface for designing and simulating electrical circuits. Users can place components, connect them with wires, and simulate the circuit to calculate node voltages and current through components.

---

## **Features**
- **Graphical Circuit Design**: Add resistors, voltage sources, current sources, and wires using an intuitive interface.
- **Grounding**: Ensures proper circuit grounding for accurate simulation.
- **Modified Nodal Analysis (MNA)**: Efficiently computes node voltages and current through elements.
- **Dynamic Simulation Results**: Displays voltages and currents with real-time updates on the circuit.
- **Error Detection**: Identifies and alerts about floating nodes, unconnected terminals, or missing ground connections.
